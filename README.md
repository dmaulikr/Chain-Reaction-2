Chain Reaction
==============

Chain Reaction is a game small made in HTML5 and Objective-C for devices running iOS.

It's a fairly simple app that uses WebView (mainly because I'm not great with Objective-C). You're free to make a branch of this for your own project, you can pretty much do anything with this, since it just loads a webpage.

Customising
==============
Editing this app for your own usage is fairly easy.

First of all, branch off, then follow these steps:
* Open ViewController.m.
* Scroll down to line 20.
* Change the URL to suit your needs.
